# Where Is That Pokemon?

This is the frontend repository of my project - Where Is That Pokemon?, which is a game to find the list of five Pokemons in an image as quickly as possible. The game is similar to the famous "Where's Waldo?" game.

The frontend of this project was super cool to write. The rect method using which I'm able to get the position is something I looked from G4G (or W3Schools I don't remember), but apart from that, every logic of this project is written by me, and I'm proud of it :)

I must give credits for the image I've used, the [Image](https://www.deviantart.com/viking011/art/Pokemon-Poster-436455502) I've used is created by [Viking011](https://www.deviantart.com/viking011). Do check him out for his awesome works.

Overall good work Lav, before starting this project it seemed like hard but it was easy lol. (16-06-2025)
